The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program
using only UNIX signals.

Chapter IV
Mandatory Part
You must create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.
• The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.
• The client takes two parameters:
◦ The server PID.
◦ The string to send.
• The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server.
Once the string has been received, the server must print it.
